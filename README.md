## ðŸŽ¨ Design & Icons
- The design reference was provided via **Figma**.  
- For certain **icons and illustrations**, I used **images directly downloaded from the Figma design**.  
  - This was done to ensure visual consistency with the provided mockups.  
  - Some icons might appear less clear because they were sourced as static images rather icons.
