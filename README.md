# Frontend Development Assignment

This repository contains the **frontend assignment** I built as part of a companyâ€™s selection process. The project is implemented using **React.js** and **JavaScript**, following the provided Figma design.

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **React.js** â€“ Component-based UI development  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€“ Application logic  
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Styling and layout  

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Design & Icons
- The design reference was provided via **Figma**.  
- For certain **icons and illustrations**, I used **images directly downloaded from the Figma design**.  
  - This was done to ensure visual consistency with the provided mockups.  
  - Some icons might appear less clear because they were sourced as static images rather icons.
